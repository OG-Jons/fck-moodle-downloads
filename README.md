# F#CK Moodle PDF Downloads
I got annoyed by always having to remove the query paramter `forcedownload` when opening pdf's in moodle, so I decided to write an extension that does this for you.

**Warning**
This extension isn't configurable and always removes it if it's present with a pdf file. It doesn't remove it for other filetypes, because I'm not sure wether other files work in the browser.
